Shuffly is a word game app where players challenge their vocabulary and puzzle-solving skills by unscrambling five-letter words.

The concept for Shuffly originated during the "100 Days of SwiftUI" course by Paul Hudson. https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui

Initially, I misunderstood the app the tutorial was guiding me through but then, instead of abandoning the idea, I decided to bring my vision to life and created Shuffly.

In Shuffly, the user has 3 attempts to guess each word. Each correct guess replenishes both the number of attempts and the countdown timer, keeping the game dynamic and exciting.

At the end of each game, the player receive a detailed summary of their performance. The end screen displays the number of correct and incorrect guesses, along with a list of all words encountered during the game. Correct guesses are highlighted in green, while incorrect ones are marked in red.

Experience the thrill of word puzzles with Shuffly, and see how many words you can unscramble!
